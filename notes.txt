Getting Started with Python in VS Code

1. Install the Python extension for VS Code

2. Create and activate the virtual environment
A best practice among Python developers is to avoid installing packages into a global interpreter environment. 
You instead use a project-specific virtual environment that contains a copy of a global interpreter. 
Once you activate that environment, any packages you then install are isolated from other environments. 
Such isolation reduces many complications that can arise from conflicting package versions.

- For Windows
py -3 -m venv .venv
.venv\scripts\activate

If the activate command generates the message "Activate.ps1 is not digitally signed. You cannot run this script on the current system.", 
then you need to temporarily change the PowerShell execution policy to allow scripts to run.

Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process

3. Install packages
python -m pip install pygame
python -m pip install pytmx

Optional (in case of WARNING: You are using pip version 20.1.1; however, version 21.3.1 is available.)
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

3. Linting Python
python -m pip install -U pylint
